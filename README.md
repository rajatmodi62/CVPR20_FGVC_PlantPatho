# CVPR 2020 - FGVC ( Plant Pathology )
The objective of this challenge is to train a model from **images** that can:  
- Classify leaves into diseased / healthy class ( *Mutually exclusive* classes - **softmax applicable** )
- A leaf may be either of the 4 classes 
    - **healthy** 
    - **multiple_diseases** 
    - **rust**
    - **scab**
- Should be able to handle **unbalanced classes** ( on class occurring very *rarely* ) and **novel symptoms** ( ??? )
- Should be able to accommodate for **perception changes** ( lighting, angle, etc )
- The model should **learn relevant details** from image ( ??? ) - Possible use of latent vector

## EDA

    - ( Amazing "Parallel categories plot of targets", Distribution of red channel values", EfficientNet NoisyStudent Prediction (great images) )

- [Google Sheet - Submitted approaches](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VVi2HST5m4LFaSr-GBiUgQdsM6oA8O-mfq3UFKyqZU8/edit?usp=sharing)

### Summary
- The data contains a **few duplicates** and has both **portrait** and **landscape** images.
- Label distribution:
    - Scab ~32%
    - Rust ~32%
    - Healthy ~28%
    - Multiple ~5%
- Color channel ( RGB ) analysis shows greater variance in B and G channels a compared to R channel.
- Parallel Category plot has guaranteed us that the labels are indeed mutually exclusive

## Model Backbone ideas
The backbones we are looking forward to explore are:
- ResNets
- EfficientNet ( B7 )
- SEResNeXts
- DenseNets ( 121 )
- EfficientNet NoisyStudent
- Ensembling ( if needed )

## Augmentation ideas
- Canny Edge detection ( to crop out only the main leaf image )
- Flipping ( horizontal and vertical )
- Using convolutions to generate sunlight effect ( Possibility for low light images ??? )
- Blurring

## Training ideas
- Train.py framework for quick testing
- Cross fold validation
- Stratified K fold validation

## Pretrained Model Weights ( GDrive links )
